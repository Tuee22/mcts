# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) implementation for the Corridors board game, featuring a high-performance C++ backend with Python bindings. The project combines advanced MCTS algorithms with efficient board representation and supports both traditional UCT and modern PUCT (Alpha-Zero style) formulations.

## Development Commands

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies with Poetry
poetry install --with dev

# Docker development (recommended)
cd docker

# CPU-only build
docker compose build    # Build images
docker compose up -d    # Run services

# GPU build (AMD64 only, requires NVIDIA Docker)
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.gpu.yaml build
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.gpu.yaml up -d
```

### Building C++ Components
```bash
# Build C++ shared library
cd backend/core
scons                    # Standard build
scons debug=1           # Debug build with symbols
scons test=1            # Build test executable
scons profile=1         # Profile build with gprof
scons sanitize=1        # Build with AddressSanitizer
```

### Testing
**IMPORTANT: All tests MUST be run inside Docker containers**

```bash
# Start Docker services first
cd docker && docker compose up -d

# Run all tests (inside container)
docker compose exec mcts pytest

# Test categories (inside container)
docker compose exec mcts pytest -m "not slow"     # Exclude slow tests
docker compose exec mcts pytest -m "slow"        # Only slow tests  
docker compose exec mcts pytest -m "integration" # Integration tests
docker compose exec mcts pytest -m "python"     # Pure Python tests
docker compose exec mcts pytest -m "cpp"        # C++ binding tests
docker compose exec mcts pytest -m "performance" # Performance tests
docker compose exec mcts pytest -m "edge_cases"  # Edge case tests

# Benchmarking (inside container)
docker compose exec mcts pytest --benchmark-only # Run benchmarks
```

### Code Quality
**IMPORTANT: All quality commands MUST be run inside Docker containers**

```bash
# Start Docker services first
cd docker && docker compose up -d

# Format code (inside container)
docker compose exec mcts black .
docker compose exec mcts isort .

# Type checking (inside container)  
docker compose exec mcts mypy --strict .

# Alternative: Run all quality checks in one command
docker compose exec mcts bash -c "black . && isort . && mypy --strict ."
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

**C++ Backend (`backend/core/`)**
- `mcts.hpp`: Generic MCTS template implementation with UCT/PUCT support
- `board.h/.cpp`: Corridors game board representation and logic
- `corridors_threaded_api.h/.cpp`: Thread-safe API wrapper for Python bindings
- `_corridors_mcts.cpp`: Boost.Python bindings module

**Python Frontend (`backend/python/corridors/`)**
- `corridors_mcts.py`: Main Python interface with `Corridors_MCTS` class
- Provides high-level API for game play, self-play, and analysis

**Test Suite (`tests/backend/` and `tests/frontend/`)**
- Comprehensive pytest-based testing with fixtures for different MCTS configurations
- Performance benchmarks and integration tests for C++/Python interop

### Key Design Patterns

**Template-based MCTS**: The C++ MCTS implementation uses templates to work with any game that implements the required interface (legal moves, evaluation, terminal detection).

**Threaded Simulation**: The `corridors_threaded_api` runs MCTS simulations continuously in background threads, allowing real-time interaction.

**Hybrid Build System**: Uses SCons for C++ compilation and Poetry for Python dependency management. Docker provides consistent cross-platform environments.

## MCTS Configuration

The system supports extensive MCTS customization:

- **Traditional UCT**: Classic Upper Confidence Bound formula
- **PUCT**: Alpha-Zero style polynomial UCT with action probabilities  
- **Rollout vs Evaluation**: Random rollouts or domain-specific heuristic evaluation
- **Child Evaluation**: Option to evaluate all children immediately upon node expansion
- **Visit vs Equity Selection**: Choose best moves by visit count or average reward

## Game Interface Requirements

For any game to work with the MCTS template, it must implement:
- `get_legal_moves()` - Generate all legal moves from current position
- `is_terminal()` - Check if game has ended
- `get_terminal_eval()` - Return final game value
- `check_non_terminal_eval()` - Check for heuristic evaluation
- `get_action_text()` - Convert move to human-readable string

## Build Notes

- C++ code requires Boost libraries (python, numpy) and C++11 support
- SCons build system supports multiple configurations (debug, profile, sanitize)
- Docker containers provide GCC-13, Python 3.12, and all required dependencies
- Poetry manages Python dependencies with strict version pinning for reproducibility

## Claude Code Integration

This repository uses Claude Code agents and automated quality assurance hooks for development.

### Automated Quality Pipeline

Every code change triggers an automated pipeline: **Format ‚Üí Type Check ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Tests**

**CRITICAL: All pipeline stages run inside Docker containers**

The pipeline runs automatically after Edit, Write, or MultiEdit operations and provides specific agent recommendations when stages fail:

```bash
‚ùå Type Check FAILED (exit code: 2)
üìã Run agent: @mypy-type-checker
üîÑ Or fix issues manually and retry
```

All agents and hooks automatically execute commands inside the mcts Docker container.

### Available Agents

#### Core Quality Assurance
- **@formatter-black**: Python code formatting with Black (PEP 8 compliance)
- **@mypy-type-checker**: Comprehensive type checking with zero tolerance policy
- **@builder-docker**: Docker container builds for development and CI
- **@tester-pytest**: Test suite execution and validation

#### Specialized Build Agents
- **@builder-cpu**: CPU-only Docker builds for development/CI
- **@builder-gpu**: GPU-enabled Docker builds (AMD64 only)
- **@no-git-commits**: Policy agent preventing automatic git commits

### Environment Configuration

Control the automated pipeline with environment variables:

```bash
export MCTS_FORMAT_CMD="docker compose exec mcts black ."
export MCTS_TYPECHECK_CMD="docker compose exec mcts mypy --strict ."
export MCTS_BUILD_CMD="docker compose build"
export MCTS_TEST_CMD="docker compose exec mcts pytest -q"
export MCTS_SKIP_BUILD="false"
export MCTS_SKIP_TESTS="false"
export MCTS_VERBOSE="true"
export MCTS_FAIL_FAST="true"
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Code changes**: Post-change hook automatically runs quality pipeline
2. **Pipeline failures**: Use recommended agents to fix issues
3. **Manual quality check**: Run agents proactively before committing
4. **Zero tolerance**: MyPy agent iterates until zero type errors

### Agent Documentation

- **Agent Registry**: `.claude/AGENTS.md` - Complete agent documentation
- **Machine-Readable**: `.claude/agents.json` - Programmatic agent definitions
- **Hook Configuration**: `.claude/settings.json` - Pipeline settings

### Quality Standards

This project enforces strict quality standards:

- **Formatting**: Black formatter with PEP 8 compliance
- **Type Safety**: MyPy strict mode with zero tolerance for Any, cast(), type: ignore
- **Testing**: Comprehensive pytest suite with 95%+ coverage
- **Build Validation**: Docker containers for consistent environments
- **Custom Type Stubs**: Project maintains custom stubs to eliminate Any usage

The automated pipeline ensures all contributions meet these standards before integration.
