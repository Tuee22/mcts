# Claude Code Hook System Bug - Deep Research Request

## Issue Summary

We are experiencing a complete failure of the Claude Code PostToolUse hook system. Despite proper configuration following official documentation, hooks are not triggering automatically after Edit, Write, or MultiEdit tool operations. This is preventing our automated quality assurance pipeline from running and maintaining code standards.

## Technical Details

### Environment
- **Platform**: macOS Darwin 24.6.0
- **Claude Code Version**: [Unknown - need to determine]
- **Project Type**: Python/C++ MCTS implementation with Docker containerization
- **Hook Configuration**: Project-level `.claude/settings.json`

### Expected Behavior
When any Edit, Write, or MultiEdit operation is performed, the PostToolUse hook should automatically execute our quality pipeline:
```
Format (Black) → Type Check (MyPy) → Build (Docker) → Tests (pytest) → Documentation Check
```

### Actual Behavior
- Hook script never executes automatically after tool operations
- No error messages or logging indicating hook attempted to run
- Manual execution of hook script works perfectly (`python3 .claude/hooks/on-change-chain.py`)
- All pipeline stages pass when run manually
- Hook system appears completely non-functional

### Configuration Details

**Current Hook Configuration** (`.claude/settings.json`):
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": {
      "command": "python3 .claude/hooks/on-change-chain.py",
      "triggers": [""],
      "description": "Automatically runs Black → MyPy → Build → Tests → Docs chain after code changes"
    }
  }
}
```

**Hook Script**: `/Users/matthewnowak/mcts/.claude/hooks/on-change-chain.py`
- **Permissions**: `rwxr-xr-x` (executable)
- **Functionality**: Verified working via manual execution
- **Dependencies**: All Docker services available and functional
- **Exit Codes**: Returns appropriate codes (0 for success, 1-6 for various failures)

### Evidence of Bug

1. **Proof of Manual Functionality**:
   ```bash
   $ python3 .claude/hooks/on-change-chain.py
   ✅ Format PASSED
   ✅ Type Check PASSED  
   ✅ Build SKIPPED
   ✅ Test PASSED
   ✅ Documentation Check PASSED
   ```

2. **Proof of Automatic Failure**:
   - Made Edit operation to `.claude/hooks/check_docs.py`
   - No hook execution occurred
   - Subsequent manual run of `@formatter-black` found 5 files to reformat
   - This proves the hook's Black formatter never ran automatically

3. **Configuration Verification**:
   - Hook script exists and is executable
   - Settings.json syntax is valid
   - Working directory is correct
   - No permission issues when running manually

## Referenced Bug Reports

Based on extensive research, this appears to be a known issue with multiple documented cases:

### Primary Issues
1. **GitHub Issue #2891**: "Hooks not executing despite following documentation"
   - URL: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/2891
   - Status: Unresolved
   - Symptoms: Identical to our issue - properly configured hooks simply don't trigger

2. **GitHub Issue #3091**: "[BUG] hooks don't seem to work per-project"  
   - URL: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/3091
   - Debug Evidence: Logs show "Found 0 hook matchers" and "Matched 0 hooks for query 'Edit'"
   - Status: Ongoing investigation

3. **GitHub Issue #3148**: "PreToolUse and PostToolUse Hooks Not Triggered with `*`"
   - URL: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/3148
   - Related to matcher pattern problems
   - Workaround: Use empty string instead of wildcard

4. **GitHub Issue #3579**: "[BUG] User settings hooks not loading"
   - URL: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/3579
   - Version regression in v1.0.51+ affecting hook loading
   - Project-level hooks vs user-level hooks distinction

### Additional Context Issues
5. **GitHub Issue #4809**: "PostToolUse Hook Exit Code 1 Blocks Claude Execution"
   - URL: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/4809
   - Related to hook blocking behavior (not our primary issue but relevant)

## Attempted Workarounds

### Workaround 1: Empty String Matcher ❌ FAILED
- **Change**: Modified `"triggers": ["Edit", "Write", "MultiEdit"]` to `"triggers": [""]`
- **Source**: GitHub Issue #3148 recommendation
- **Result**: No improvement, hooks still don't trigger

### Workaround 2: Verified Project-Level Configuration ✅ CONFIRMED
- **Status**: Hook is configured in project `.claude/settings.json` (not user-level)
- **Reasoning**: Addresses Issue #3579 about user settings not loading
- **Result**: Configuration is correct, but issue persists

### Workaround 3: Manual Verification ✅ CONFIRMED  
- **Status**: Hook script functionality verified through manual execution
- **Result**: Eliminates script bugs as the cause - this is a hook trigger system bug

## Research Questions for GPT-5

Given this comprehensive analysis of a confirmed Claude Code platform bug affecting PostToolUse hook triggering, please provide:

### 1. Root Cause Analysis
- What are the likely underlying technical causes of this hook system failure?
- Are there specific Claude Code architecture patterns that make hooks unreliable?
- How does the hook matching/triggering mechanism work internally, and where might it be failing?

### 2. Advanced Diagnostic Approaches
- What debugging techniques could help identify exactly where in the hook pipeline the failure occurs?
- Are there environment variables, log files, or debugging flags that could provide more insight?
- How can we determine the exact Claude Code version and confirm if this is a version-specific regression?

### 3. Comprehensive Workaround Strategies
Beyond the documented workarounds we've tried, suggest:
- Alternative hook configuration patterns that might bypass the bug
- Different approaches to automated quality assurance that don't rely on Claude's hook system
- Ways to implement polling or file-watching mechanisms as fallbacks
- Integration patterns with external automation tools (GitHub Actions, pre-commit hooks, etc.)

### 4. Long-term Solution Architecture
- How should we architect our development workflow to be resilient against this type of platform bug?
- What are best practices for critical automation that doesn't depend on potentially unreliable platform features?
- Should we implement redundant automation systems, and if so, what patterns work best?

### 5. Communication and Escalation Strategy
- How should this bug be properly reported to maximize chances of resolution?
- What additional technical details would be most valuable for Claude Code developers?
- Are there alternative channels or approaches for getting platform bugs addressed quickly?

### 6. Alternative Implementation Approaches
- Can we implement equivalent functionality using Claude Code's other features (agents, different hook types, etc.)?
- Are there creative ways to trigger our quality pipeline that don't rely on PostToolUse hooks?
- What external tools or integrations might provide more reliable automation?

## Expected Deliverables

Please provide:
1. **Technical analysis** of the most likely root causes
2. **Actionable workarounds** ranked by probability of success
3. **Alternative architecture recommendations** for reliable automation
4. **Step-by-step debugging guide** to gather more diagnostic information
5. **Communication template** for effective bug reporting to Claude Code team

## Success Criteria

An ideal solution would:
- Restore automatic execution of our quality pipeline after code changes
- Provide reliable, consistent automation without manual intervention  
- Be resilient against future Claude Code platform changes or bugs
- Maintain our current development workflow and productivity standards

## Additional Context

This issue is blocking our development workflow automation and forcing manual execution of critical quality checks (formatting, type checking, testing, documentation validation). The impact extends beyond convenience - it risks code quality degradation and introduces potential for human error in our development process.

Our team has invested significant effort in creating a comprehensive automated quality pipeline, and this platform bug is preventing us from realizing those benefits. We need either a reliable workaround or an alternative approach that provides equivalent automation capabilities.
