# Tools

Development and debugging tools for the Corridors MCTS project.

## Structure

- `debug/` - Debug scripts for analyzing game states and MCTS behavior

## Debug Scripts

The debug scripts help analyze various aspects of the MCTS algorithm:

- `debug_terminal.py` - Check terminal state detection
- `debug_evaluation.py` - Analyze position evaluation
- `debug_board_state.py` - Examine board representations

## Usage

Run debug scripts from the project root:

```bash
python tools/debug/debug_terminal.py
```
